## Server

## Routing

All routing metrics are reported by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing` meter.

### Metric: `aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts`

<!-- semconv metric.aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts` | Counter | `{match_attempt}` | Number of requests that were attempted to be matched to an endpoint. [1] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |  |

**[1]:** Meter name: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing`; Added in: ASP.NET Core 8.0

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`aspnetcore.routing.match_status`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | string | Match result - success or failure | `success`; `failure` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`aspnetcore.routing.is_fallback`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | boolean | A value that indicates whether the matched route is a fallback route. | `true` | `Conditionally Required` if and only if a route was successfully matched. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`http.route`](/docs/registry/attributes/http.md) | string | The matched route, that is, the path template in the format used by the respective server framework. [1] | `/users/:userID?`; `{controller}/{action}/{id?}` | `Conditionally Required` if and only if a route was successfully matched. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `http.route`:** MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

---

`aspnetcore.routing.match_status` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `failure` | Match failed | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `success` | Match succeeded | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

## Exceptions

Exceptions Metric is reported by the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics` meter.

### Metric: `aspnetcore.diagnostics.exceptions`

<!-- semconv metric.aspnetcore.diagnostics.exceptions -->
<!-- NOTE: THIS TEXT IS AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. -->
<!-- see templates/registry/markdown/snippet.md.j2 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

| Name     | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description    | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `aspnetcore.diagnostics.exceptions` | Counter | `{exception}` | Number of exceptions caught by exception handling middleware. [1] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |  |

**[1]:** Meter name: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics`; Added in: ASP.NET Core 8.0

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`aspnetcore.diagnostics.exception.result`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | string | ASP.NET Core exception middleware handling result. | `handled`; `unhandled` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | string | The full name of exception type. [1] | `System.OperationCanceledException`; `Contoso.MyException` | `Required` | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`aspnetcore.diagnostics.handler.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/aspnetcore.md) | string | Full type name of the [`IExceptionHandler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.iexceptionhandler) implementation that handled the exception. | `Contoso.MyHandler` | `Conditionally Required` [2] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

**[2] `aspnetcore.diagnostics.handler.type`:** if and only if the exception was handled by this handler.

---

`aspnetcore.diagnostics.exception.result` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `aborted` | Exception handling didn't run because the request was aborted. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `handled` | Exception was handled by the exception handling middleware. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `skipped` | Exception handling was skipped because the response had started. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| `unhandled` | Exception was not handled by the exception handling middleware. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `aspnetcore.rate_limiting.policy`:** if the matched endpoint for the request had a rate-limiting policy.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
